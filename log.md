# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 25, 2021 
**Today's Progress**: I learned some more JS focusing on writing on functions and getting really familiar with the DOM.

**Thoughts**: I feel more confident with JS than I did last work.  It's logical to me but the syntax can be frustrating.  Nervous about function expressions and arrays but I will be victorious.  A couple of months ago I knew nothing about HTML or CSS but now I can bang out a website that's functional and decent looking. Nowhere to go but up.

**Day 1**: January 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some JS.  Also a little HTML. 

**Thoughts**:  I really love development and I'm happy I am able to explore this path.

**Day 2**: January 27, 20201
**Today's Progress**:  Review HTML forms and some JS.  Feel like I have a good handle on my studies.

**Thoughts**: Wish I was further along in JS.
