# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 25, 2021 
**Today's Progress**: I learned some more JS focusing on writing on functions and getting really familiar with the DOM.

**Thoughts:** I feel more confident with JS than I did last work.  It's logical to me but the syntax can be frustrating.  Nervous about function expressions and arrays but I will be victorious.  A couple of months ago I knew nothing about HTML or CSS but now I can bang out a website that's functional and decent looking. Nowhere to go but up.
